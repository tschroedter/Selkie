# Selkie
The main goal of the Selkie project is to calculate and displays the shortest path for a boat travelling along survey lines from point A to B. The algorithm takes into account the minimum required turn circle of a vessel required to navigate from one line to another.

The project started as a little ant colony optimization application. Over time the application grew and was split up into different services which communicate via EasyNetQ/RabbitMQ and use Castle Windsor. The whole project is used to try out TDD, BDD, DRY and SOLID.
